## Models

### User (users.User)
- Extends `AbstractUser` (has username, password, email, etc.)
- `type` field — position, in **increasing hierarchy order**: MSO, Sr. MSO, DASM, ASM, Sr. ASM, DRSM, RSM, Sr. RSM, DSM, SM, Sr. SM, AGM, GM, Sr. GM, HR, Admin (default: MSO)
- `TYPE_RANK` (position → rank), `hierarchy_level` property, and `viewable_report_users()` — self plus everyone at a strictly lower position (superusers see all)
- Legacy types migrated in `users.0003`: MR → MSO, SGM → SR_GM
- `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"` in settings

### Doctor (doctors.Doctor)
- `name` — CharField(255)
- `nmc_number` — CharField(50), unique, "Nepal Medical Council Number"
- `hospital` — FK to Hospital (PROTECT), **required** (existing rows backfilled in `doctors.0005` with a per-area "General Hospital")
- `area` — CharField(255), free text (used as "City" in reports)
- `specialization` — CharField(255), optional
- `phone` — CharField(20), optional
- `email` — EmailField, optional
- Ordered by name; added via Django admin or the HR "Add Doctor" form (`/doctors/add/`)
- Phone/email surface in the doctor list ("Contact" column + client-side search), the add form, admin, and `GET /api/doctors/`

### Hospital (doctors.Hospital)
- `name` — CharField(255); `area` — FK to Area (PROTECT); `phone` — optional
- Unique on (name, area); managed via Django admin
- Surfaces in the Add Doctor form (required select), doctor list column, `GET /api/doctors/` (`hospital_id` + `hospital_name`), and the Yearly Activity report's "Hospital" column (previously derived from worked areas)

### Chemist / Stockist masters (daily_coverage.Chemist / .Stockist)
- `name` — CharField(255); `area` — FK to Area (PROTECT); `phone` — optional; unique on (name, area)
- Added by HR at `/chemists/add/` and `/stockists/add/` (shared `add_partner.html` template) or via Django admin
- The daily-coverage bulk form picks chemists/stockists from these directories (select pre-fills the entry's area); coverage rows still store the name as text

### Area (tour_plans.Area)
- `name` — CharField(255), unique
- Shared between TourPlan and DailyCoverage
- Managed via Django admin

### TourPlan (tour_plans.TourPlan)
- `created_by` — FK to User (nullable)
- `reporting_date` — DateField, auto-set on create
- `plan_date` — DateField
- `area` — FK to Area (PROTECT)
- `worked_with` — FK to User, optional
- `remarks` — TextField, optional
- `status` — choices: pending / approved / rejected (default: pending)
- HR must approve before employee can add daily coverage for that date

### DoctorEmployeeRelation (doctor_employee_relation.DoctorEmployeeRelation)
- `employee` — FK to User
- `doctor` — FK to Doctor
- `msl_number` — PositiveIntegerField, optional (importance rank — drives category)
- `relation_date` — DateField, optional
- `status` — choices: pending / approved / rejected (default: pending)
- Unique constraint on (employee, doctor)
- Field reps (MSOs) request assignments; HR users (is_staff + type=="HR") approve/reject

### DailyCoverage (daily_coverage.DailyCoverage)
- `created_by` — FK to User (nullable)
- `report_date` — DateField
- `work_day` — choices: full_day / half_day / night_transit / meeting (default full_day); one **required** "Working day" select on the add form applies to all doctor entries in that submission
- `doctor` — FK to Doctor (PROTECT)
- `actual_working_place` — FK to Area (PROTECT)
- `call_time` — TimeField
- `products` — CharField(255), blank at model level but **required by the add form** (client gate + server-side skip)
- `worked_with` — CharField(255), stored as text; add/edit forms offer a select of "Self" + colleagues, **required on add** (defaults to "Self")
- `remarks` — TextField, optional
- Edit/delete allowed within 2 days of `created_at`; enforced in view with `PermissionDenied`

### ChemistCoverage / StockistCoverage (daily_coverage)
- `created_by` — FK to User (nullable)
- `report_date` — DateField
- `name` — CharField(255) — chemist/stockist name (picked from the Chemist/Stockist master directories in the bulk form; stored as text)
- `area` — FK to Area (PROTECT)
- `call_time` — TimeField
- `created_at` — DateTimeField (no `updated_at` yet)
- Structurally identical to each other; entered alongside doctors in the same bulk add form
- Logging only chemist/stockist on a doctor-less day requires a "no doctor coverage" reason (gate only — the reason is validated but not persisted)
- Listed in Coverage records via `?type=chemist|stockist` with edit/delete in the same 2-day window (`edit_chemist_coverage` etc.); also surfaced in the Daily Activity report

## Doctor Classification (MSL-based)
Used across all reports and the daily coverage calendar:
| Class | MSL range | Monthly visit target |
|---|---|---|
| Super Core | 1 – 25 | 4 |
| Core | 26 – 75 | 2 |
| VIP | 76+ (or no MSL) | 1 |

Defined in `reports/views.py` as `SUPER_CORE_MAX = 25`, `CORE_MAX = 75`, `VISIT_TARGETS`.

## Tour Plan → Daily Coverage Flow
1. MR submits tour plan (status: pending)
2. HR approves/rejects from `/tour_plans/review/`
3. Calendar shows approved days as clickable ("Plan Approved" badge)
4. MR adds daily coverage (doctor + optional chemist/stockist) only for approved-plan days (enforced on POST for every row)
5. Logging only chemist/stockist on a doctor-less day requires a "no doctor coverage" reason; the form's Chemist/Stockist tabs stay locked until a doctor entry exists or that reason is given (client-side gate + server-side validation)
6. All coverage (doctor/chemist/stockist) can be edited/deleted within 2 days from Coverage records; calendar shows "Added (n)" badge (doctor rows only) linking to list — the badge swaps its dot for a lock icon (+ tooltip and legend entry) once every entry on that day is past the edit window
7. The add form walks Doctor → Chemist → Stockist with a footer Next button; Next and Save All stay disabled until every added row's required fields are complete (client-side; server re-validates)

## API Endpoints (Django Ninja)
- `POST /api/token/pair` — Get JWT access + refresh tokens
- `POST /api/token/refresh` — Refresh access token
- `GET /api/doctors/` — List all doctors (JWT auth required)
- Swagger docs at `/api/docs`

## Auth Flow
- **Templates:** Django session auth (`@login_required` + `@never_cache`)
- **API:** JWT via `django-ninja-jwt` (for future React/mobile)
- Logout uses POST (Django 5+ requirement)
- `@never_cache` on all authenticated views to prevent back-button access after logout
- HR-only views check `user.is_staff and user.type == "HR"` and raise `PermissionDenied`
- **Reports:** hierarchy-based visibility via `_get_employee` (reports/views.py) — a user sees their own reports plus those of strictly lower positions; requesting anyone else 404s; template flag `can_view_others` shows the employee dropdown

## Credentials (dev only)
- **Admin login:** `admin` / `admin123` (type: GM, superuser)
- **DB:** `pharmasfo` / `pharmasfo_dev_password` on host port `5433`

## Design Decisions
- **UI:** Lumo SFA design system — `static/lumo/` files are verbatim copies from `lumo/design_handoff_lumo_sfa/` (never re-derive colors/spacing; extend by composing `components.css` classes). `base.html` renders the app shell for all authenticated pages. The `.scrim` div must stay the **last** child of `.app` — as first child it occupies the grid's first cell and breaks the desktop layout.
- **Action feedback:** views use `django.contrib.messages` (success/warning/error) for every create/edit/delete/approve/reject, including saved-vs-skipped counts on bulk forms; `base.html` renders them as Lumo toasts via `window.lumoToast` (defined in `lumo/lumo.js`). Add a message in the view and it just works.
- **A11y:** skip-to-content link in `base.html`, `aria-current="page"` set on the active nav item, autofocus on the primary field of add forms; inline SVG favicon (data URI) in `base.html` + `login.html`
- **Mobile tables:** wide list tables use `.table.table--stack` (defined in `static/css/app.css`) — under 860px each row collapses into a labeled card; every `<td>` needs `data-label`, `.stack-hide` hides noise cells (e.g. SN). Grid-like report tables (monthly list, yearly) intentionally keep horizontal scroll.
- **All pages are Lumo-ported** and empty the `{% block legacy_css %}` — `css/style.css` is no longer loaded anywhere (kept only for reference; safe to delete). The base template's `legacy_css` default remains as a safety net for any future non-ported template. Shared page patterns: `page-header` (title + sub + `page-actions`), `table-toolbar` for filters, `.table-wrap > .table` with `badge--success/warning/danger` status pills, `.empty` states, `card__footer` with ghost Cancel + primary submit for forms; report charts read colors from Lumo CSS variables via `getComputedStyle`
- Report visibility follows the position hierarchy (see User model); "subordinate" currently means *any lower position* — direct-report chains would need a `manager` FK
- HR users (is_staff=True, type="HR") approve doctor assignments and tour plans
- Tour plan approval gates daily coverage entry for that date
- Doctor classification (Super Core/Core/VIP) derived from MSL number at report time, not stored
- Daily coverage edit window is 2 days from `created_at` (defined as `EDIT_WINDOW_DAYS = 2`)
- Chemist/Stockist coverage is implemented (models + bulk add form + list/edit/delete + Daily Activity report); inclusion in monthly/target/yearly reports is still pending
- List views (`daily_coverage_list`, `doctor_employee_relation_list`) paginate at 25/page with date/status filters
- **Coverage calendar renders in Bikram Sambat** via `nepali-datetime`: the `/daily_coverage/<year>/<month>/` URL params are **BS**, weeks run Sunday-first, cells show the BS day (AD date bottom-right), and all queries/links use the BS month's AD range. Storage and reports remain Gregorian
- **BS date picker** (`static/js/bs-date.js` + `{% bs_calendar_json %}` tag in dc_tags, both loaded by base.html): renders Year/Month/Day BS selects that write ISO AD into a hidden input. Auto-enhances every server-rendered `input[type=date]` (filters, edit forms); JS-built entry rows call `bsDateAttach(input, {defaultToday})`. Month inputs (`type=month`) stay Gregorian
- Excel export uses openpyxl, served as streaming `HttpResponse`
- `reports/` is a plain Python module (no models), not a Django app — no INSTALLED_APPS entry
- Timezone set to `Asia/Kathmandu`
- DB host port is 5433 (5432 was already in use on the dev machine)
